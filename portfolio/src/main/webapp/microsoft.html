    <h1 id = "title">Microsoft Internship</h1>

    <br/>
    <h2 class = "section-header">Overview</h2>
    <p >
        Last summer I interned at Microsoft in a program called New Technologists. This was a seven week program where we were randomly assigned to a team and building, with each building having a unique theme. Mine was Distracted Multitaskers. We built a mobile application in Swift called Ascend. At the end of the program, my project was selected among the best, and my team was given the opportunity to present to VP's of Microsoft, including Perry Clarke.

    <h2 class = "section-header">Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p class = "center">
                The first process of the internship was to design a problem statement. A problem statement follows the form of: How might we _____ by ____ so that ______. During this phase our mentors kept denying our problem statement. It got to a point where every team had finished this part except us. However, due us rethinking and modifying our problem statement so many times, we knew exactly what we wanted and this facilitated all other processes of design and development.  
            </p>

        <h3>Idea</h3>
            <p class = "center">  
                We decided to develop a task managing app with a socail platform. The idea was to reverse the negative implication of a distraction (social media) and flip it into a postive (getting work done).

        <h3>Swot / Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p class = "center">
                Once we had our idea, we needed to compare it with other similar ideas and tweaked ours to keep a competitive advantage. For example, because of this we decided to add a personal achievements page to have another form of confidence boost from the user as well as keep them engaged in our app.

        <h3>User feedback</h3>
            <p class = "center">
                There was a user feedback BBQ event were Microsoft employees would provide feedback on our ideas.

        <br/>
        <h3>User Priorities</h3>
            <p class = "center">
                We created user stories. Based on the importance of each of these tasks, we placed them into categories. P0 represented the most important, P1 represented medium importance, and P2 the least important. We then placed these into a Kanban board and split up the tasks. 
            </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Development</h3>
            <p class = "center">
                I specifically worked on the task management page as well as the backend. My goal was to ensure that as a task was completed, there would be a request sent and accepted from all the other pages, so that they could be updated. For example, as a task was completed, if it was academic it would be automatically posted to the social network, as well as updating the personal achievements page. I also set up the basic framework of connectivity among all the pages. Finally, I took care of data management to ensure that the data was properly read and updated the information.
