            <p>This project was an online version of the card game sequence. I used sockets to create client-server connectivity. The game was setup using sockets so that three players could join the game from different devices via a PORT number. I also made a single player mode with a smart AI that decides the best possible move based on the current game state. </p>

            <p>Designed and programmed a webpage as a course assignment for a local bakery: The Butterwood Bake Consortium. My page includes an algorithm that would decide a cake based on your interests and preferences. This page includes the basic functionality required from the bakery, such as placing orders, viewing existing menu items, listing busy hours, and contacting the store. This site is responsive.</p>

            <p>This was a group assignment where I worked on this wallet page. I created the models for the individual wallets using a JSON file, which I then would read to create the individual waller items. I also built a filtering system based on attributes such as type, price, popular, and model. I dynamically updated the html of the page upon the filtered selections. I also wrote a script to generate the star score drawings. This page is responsive.</p>

            <p>I created a custom version of Mario with all new enemies, powerups, and boss battles. I also gave the user the ability to customize their character selection by playing as Bowser. </p>

            <p>I wrote the backend for this site. Given a txt file with southern phrases, I used Markov Chains to analyze the words and develop a predictive word generator. The code uses probabilities to determine the next best possible words and creates a new phrase based on the existing ones. </p>

            <p>Class assignment where we programmed a virtual machine in c0 (safe subset of C). This included handling the operand stack, bytecode, program counter, local varaibles, call stack, constant pools, function pools, and the heap. For the (No posted code due to course policy.

            <p>Class assignment where we programmed the huffman compression algorithm. Used trees to encode and decode bit strings, as well as programming the file compression by packing and unpacking bits into bytes. (No posted code due to course policy. For access to code, please contact me)</p>
